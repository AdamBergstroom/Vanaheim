## Vanaheim ##

## About the app ##
Vanaheim is an app that was used to create work projects with data and generate pdf files from that data. It was meant to make their job easier when working out in the field area and for database storage.

This app only stores data locally, so no backend service is used. 

Follow the instructions bellow to try the app yourself.

App can be found on Google Play as well: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.vanaheim.vanaheim
